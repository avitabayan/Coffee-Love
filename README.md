# Coffee-Love
Hello everyone and welcome to the bootstrap project.
But this project you'll be recreating a landing page and a sign in page that takes advantage of a lot of.
Bitstrips features.
we're going to do is create this Jumbotron add some content to the Jumbotron.
Have these two paragraphs here.
These large sums add the pictures the coffees the thumbnail class and then make sure that we have the nav bar.
And then if I click on the sign and it takes me to the form we also want to make sure that we get the grid system right.
Or actually adding these thumbnails of the coffee pictures and we have the links to these coffee pictures right here on these links right here.
So one two three takes it to images of coffee.
